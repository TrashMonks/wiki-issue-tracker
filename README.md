# Wiki issue tracker

Issue tracker for the [Caves of Qud wiki](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/).

See the [issues](/../../issues) page to view outstanding issues or file a new
issue. Please read the contribution guidelines below before filing an issue.

## Contribution guidelines

### What this repository is for

This repository (and more specifically, its [issue tracker](/../../issues)) is
intended to help keep track of major outstanding issues in the wiki. The
following kinds of issues are appropriate to file to the tracker:

- **Reporting missing game content:** you may use the issue tracker to report
  game content that is missing from the wiki (i.e. creatures, items, quests,
  etc.). Please _do not_ use the tracker to report a minor detail that is
  missing from a page (see the section below).
- **Requests for new pages or guides:** you may submit a request for someone to
  create a new wiki page or a guide for the wiki through the tracker. Keep in
  mind that wiki editors are volunteers and may not necessarily have the time or
  willingness to write long-form content on the topic of your choice.
- **Requesting significant updates to existing pages:** many pages on the wiki
  are out of date and may be missing significant amounts of information. For
  example, some updates have historically revamped existing factions; it would
  be appropriate to file an issue when those changes have not been reflected in
  the wiki.
- **Reporting technical errors:** fixes for templating errors in the wiki
  usually require technical expertise that wiki contributors are not expected to
  have.

### What this repository is _not_ for

- **Typos or minor inaccuracies:** we ask that if you notice a typo or a small
  inaccuracy in the wiki, you edit it yourself rather than file an issue. These
  issues can typically be resolved in far less time than it takes to file an
  issue on them. If you need an account to fix a minor issue that you observe,
  please submit an [account creation
  request](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Special:RequestAccount) 

We ask that you respect these guidelines. People who break these rules may be
banned from submitting further issues.

### Getting help

In some situations you may wish to submit a minor edit to the wiki but may not
know all of the information you need (e.g., "I'd like to write something about
how quick Galgals are, but how much quickness do they actually have?"). For
questions like these, you are encouraged to ask around in the `#wiki-discussion`
channel of the Caves of Qud Discord.

## Getting involved with the wiki

If you're interested in participating in writing and editing content for the
Caves of Qud wiki, submit an [account creation
request](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Special:RequestAccount) through the
website.

If you're just getting started as a wiki editor, a good place to look for
outstanding wiki issues is to [check issues tracked with
`good-first-issue`](/../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
